            "despite the fact that the utilization of the full potential, which these sensors have, " +
            "could significantly change mobile gaming. " +

            "1. Before you start to play, you should stand firmly on your feet " +
            "and hold your device with both hands before you.\n \n" +
            "2. While playing, you should try to move primarily with your torso " +
            "and put your legs or hands in use only when you have to. " +
            "(This approach is more beneficial for your back, but it's only a recommendation.)\n \n" +
            "3. Tap on the left half of the display will slow your speed, tap on the right half will do the oposite. \n \n" +

            "I've equipped Wormkout with a crude music player. " +
            "I hope it will be intuitive enough. Left half contains playlist with songs, " +
            "right half allows you to search " +
            "through your sdcard and add your own mp3 music. When you add at least one song, you can " +
            "disable the default music (in case you don't like it). \n \n" +
            "Gates in the game are dynamically colored in accordance with frequency spectrum of " +
            "the song which is played at that time. Because quick changes in color could be " +
            "obtrusive in close distance, dynamic gate coloring takes place only on " +
            "gates in certain distance from you.\n \n" +
            "Oh and I almost forgot about the crazy TTS (text to speech) voice who sometimes speaks to you. " +
            "If TTS bothers you, go into settings and mute the sound effects. The same goes for music.";
