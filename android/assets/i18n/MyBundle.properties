cWDonatePaypalText=And if you consider my work worthy enough, you can buy me some ale, meal, or even a day off :-) via PayPal donations.
cWlibGDXCreditsText=This game is build mostly around libGDX. libGDX is an open source, cross-platform Java game development framework.
cWIncompetechCreditsText=Default songs used in this game ("Take a Chance", "Master of the Feast", "Tafi Maradi no voice", licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0.) have been made by Kevin MacLeod.
cwAboutMeText=My name is T. Schmidt/Smith (depends on location and whether I took my pills ;-)). I am not really a game developer. I might be a bit crazy physicist who tries to earn some resources for more important projects. On the other hand, I might not, I might not even exist. Well... Who cares, lets talk about Wormkout.
cwAboutWormkoutText=Besides the fact that current generation phones and tablets have more computational power than big computers had a few years back, they are also full of sensors people often even don't know about. Wormkout represents an attempt to increase the interest in accelerometers, magnetometers and gyroscopes. In my opinion, these sensors are currently neglected by game developers despite the fact that the utilization of the full potential, which these sensors have, could significantly change mobile gaming. Yes, there are tilting games, but a small tilt of your device hardly engages you in any real physical movement.\n \n Ask your self, when was the last time a mobile game required from you a physical activity? Computer age seems to be depriving younger generations from the simple joy of playing games away from comfortable chairs and we should fix this situation. That is the second important aspect where Wormkout comes in. Since our devices are practically always with us, one or two levels of Wormkout any time during the day can stretch your back and you might not even notice it has been done so.

hWMusicTitle=Music
hWSoundsTitle=Sound effects
hWHowPlayIntroText=If you try to play Wormkout without knowing how, you might first think it's a very bad tilting game. Wormkout is NOT a tilting game. Tilting won't get you very far and in order to finish level, you will have to move not only your device, but also yourself. Once you realize this, you will be fine.
hWHowPlayText=Here is few steps you should follow to play "properly":\n \n 1. Before you start to play, you should stand firmly on your feet and hold your device upright with both hands. (Otherwise you won't be able to finish calibration.)\n \n 2. While playing, you should try to move primarily with your torso and put your legs or hands in use only when you have to. (This approach is more beneficial for your back, but it's only a recommendation.)\n \n 3. Tap on the left half of the display will slow your speed, tap on the right half will do the opposite. \n \n 4. Descent or ascent can be done in various ways. Tilting with hands is easy, bending your back might be a bit harder... \n \n That's all there is to it, now you can enjoy the ride.\n
hWSpeedSign=Finishing normal level is automatically rewarded by unlocking first speed mark. Finishing level with average speed 15 gates/s or higher is rewarded with second speed mark. The third is for average speed 20 gates/s and higher.
hWHowMusicText=Music is a matter of personal taste, that's why I've equipped Wormkout with a music player. I hope it will be intuitive enough. Left half contains playlist with your songs, right half allows you to search through your sdcard and add your own mp3 music. When you add at least one song, you can disable the default music (in case you don't like it). As expected, if you don't want music at all, go into settings and mute music volume.
hWHowSoundsText=I almost forgot about the crazy TTS (text to speech) voice who sometimes speaks to you. The quality of TTS voice depends significantly on your device settings. If it sounds too monotone, please consider installing any high quality voice package, which can read with some intonation. In case you don't want TTS at all, go into settings and mute the sound effects volume.

tmp=Before you dive into real play, it's good to know how to control the game... So I'd like to ask you to go through short tutorial level first (or visit help for more detailed instructions). \n After you close this dialog, you will be asked to Sign In Google Play Game Services. It's up to you, but it's recommended.
tmp2=Gates in the game are dynamically colored in accordance with frequency spectrum of the song which is played at that time. Because quick changes in color could be obtrusive in close distance, dynamic gate coloring takes place only on gates in certain distance from you (partially depends on your speed).
